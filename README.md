# COMP0002 Principles of Programming, C Coursework <br>Maze Auto-generator and Auto-solver

## About

Maze Auto-generator and Auto-solver first generates a solvable maze, which has the size of 15 Ã— 15, using randomized Kruskal's algorithm.
Then, the robot will search the way from the starting point to the exit marker, using Depth-first search (DPS).
The program shows the robot's motion as it searches the exit from the start position.

## Command
To run this program, the following files should be in the same directory.

drawapp-2.0.jar\
graphics.h\
graphics.c\
